                <h2>European settlements</h2>
               <p>The first Europeans to arrive in the continental United States were Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de Le√≥n, who made his first expedition to Florida in 1513.[47] Even earlier, Christopher Columbus had landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage, and San Juan was settled by the Spanish a decade later. The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, such as Saint Augustine, often considered the nation's oldest city,[48] and Santa Fe. The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River, notably New Orleans.[49] Successful English settlement of the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and with the Pilgrims colony at Plymouth in 1620.[50][51] The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses, was founded in 1619. Documents such as the Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[52][53] Many settlers were dissenting Christians who came seeking religious freedom. In 1784, Russians were the first Europeans to establish a settlement in Alaska, at Three Saints Bay. Russian America once spanned much of the present-day state of Alaska.[54]
In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and European settlers. In many cases, however, the natives and settlers came to depend on one another. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts; natives for guns, tools and other European goods.[55] Natives taught many settlers to cultivate corn, beans, and other foodstuffs. European missionaries and others felt it was important to "civilize" the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural practices and lifestyles.[56][57] However, with the increased European colonization of North America, the Native Americans were displaced and often killed.[58] The native population of America declined after European arrival for various reasons,[59][60][61] primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles.[62][63] </p>

              <h2>Independence and expansion</h2>
            <p>The American Revolutionary War fought by the Thirteen Colonies against the British Empire was the first successful war of independence by a non-European entity against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of "republicanism", asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their "rights as Englishmen" and "no taxation without representation". The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war.[76]
                The Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776; this day is celebrated annually as Independence Day.[77] In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[77]
                After its defeat at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty became internationally recognized, and the country was granted all lands east of the Mississippi River. Tensions with Britain remained, however, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[78] Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches in 1789, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington, who had led the Continental Army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.[79] </p>

               <h2>Wildlife and conservation</h2>
            <p>The U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing a large amount of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and more than 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[200] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species,[201] as well as about 91,000 insect species.[202]

                There are 62 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas.[203] Altogether, the government owns about 28% of the country's land area,[204] mostly in the western states.[205] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching, and about .86% is used for military purposes.[206][207]
                
                Environmental issues include debates on oil and nuclear energy, dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation,[208][209] and climate change.[210][211] The most prominent environmental agency is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), created by presidential order in 1970.[212] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[213] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.[214]
                
                The United States is ranked 24th among nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[215] </p>

               <h2>Geo</h2>
            <p>The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[192] The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[193] States bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.[194] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country in the world.[195]

                The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[196] It left the Paris Agreement in 2020,[197] and rejoined it in 2021.[198] </p>

            <div>
                <h2>Main</h2>
                <p>The United States is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[289][290][291] It is the world's oldest surviving federation. It is a federal republic and a representative democracy "in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law."[292] The U.S. ranked 25th on the Democracy Index in 2018.[293] On Transparency International's 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index, its public sector position deteriorated from a score of 76 in 2015 to 69 in 2019.[294]

                    In the American federalist system, citizens are usually subject to three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district.
                    
                    The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the U.S. Constitution, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.[295] The original text of the Constitution establishes the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states. Article One protects the right to the writ of habeas corpus. The Constitution has been amended 27 times;[296] the first ten amendments, which make up the Bill of Rights, and the Fourteenth Amendment form the central basis of Americans' individual rights. All laws and governmental procedures are subject to judicial review and any law ruled by the courts to be in violation of the Constitution is voided. The principle of judicial review, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, was established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803)[297] in a decision handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall.[298] </p>

                <h2>Political divisions</h2>
                <p>The 50 states are the principal political divisions in the country. Each state holds jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. They are subdivided into counties or county equivalents and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C.[306] The states and the District of Columbia choose the president of the United States. Each state has presidential electors equal to the number of their representatives and senators in Congress; the District of Columbia has three because of the 23rd Amendment.[307] Territories of the United States such as Puerto Rico do not have presidential electors, and so people in those territories cannot vote for the president.[303]</p>

                <h2>Science and technology</h2>
                <p>The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.[391] In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector.[392] The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor.[393][394]

                    In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's research laboratory, one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera.[395] The latter led to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers, in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.[396] </p>

                <h2>Income, poverty and wealth</h2>
                <p>Accounting for 4.24% of the global population, Americans collectively possess 29.4% of the world's total wealth, the largest percentage of any country.[402][403] Americans also make up roughly half of the world's population of millionaires.[404] The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013.[405] Americans on average have more than twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as EU residents.[406] For 2017 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 13th among 189 countries in its Human Development Index (HDI) and 25th among 151 countries in its inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI).[407]</p>

                <h2>Transportation</h2>
                <p>Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads.[429] The United States has the world's second-largest automobile market,[430] and has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, with 816.4 vehicles per 1,000 Americans (2014).[431] In 2017, there were 255,009,283 non-two wheel motor vehicles, or about 910 vehicles per 1,000 people.[432]

                    The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[433] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[434] Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport.[435] </p>
